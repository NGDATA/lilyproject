Lily Runtime
============

The Lily Runtime is a simple module platform which is used to bootstrap the
lily-server process.

When Lily Runtime starts, it reads a conf/runtime/wiring.xml file and boots
up all the modules listed in there.

A module is a jar file, containing two special things in a LILY-INF directory:

 - a Spring bean container definition
 - a classpath description

The classpath description is usually not written manually, but generated by
a Maven plugin.

All references to jar files are based on Maven coordinates (group id,
artifact id, version), and the Lily Runtime looks these up in a Maven
style repository (only on the local file system, it doesn't do downloading
of dependencies).

Service exports & imports
-------------------------

The different modules can exchange services. If they wouldn't be able to do
this, each module would be an island. A module can make services available
to other modules by exporting them using a lily:export-service directive
in the Spring bean container. Exports can only be based on interfaces,
not classes. A module can depend on a service offered by another module
by importing it using the import-service directive.

Modules should be listed in the correct order in the wiring.xml so
that dependencies can be satisfied, thus the Lily Runtime will not figure
out the correct startup order itself.
