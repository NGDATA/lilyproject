      We dance and the music dies.

      Interestingly enough in HTML there are
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        accepted bad habits and sloppy tags like this one that are not properly closed
        <p>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        even tags like
        <br>
        </br>
        and
        <img src="none.gif">
        </img>
        that have no closing counterpart
      </li>
      <li>
        or attributes like
        <hr noshade="">
        </hr>
        that have no value
      </li>
      <li>
        and entities like é and © that simply do not exist in XML
      </li>
    </ul>
