                             ---------------

Samples can be run by starting Kauri within the sample directory.

For example, to try the template samples, one would do:


[on unix systems]

cd kauri-template-sample
../../bin/kauri.sh -r ../../lib/

[on windows systems]

cd kauri-template-sample
..\..\bin\kauri -r ..\..\lib\

and then browse to

http://localhost:8888
