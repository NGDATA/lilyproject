Java Service Wrapper
====================

This directory contains Tanuki Software's Java Service Wrapper, and
a common wrapper configuration file for Kauri projects.

The intended way to use this is to package your Kauri-based application
using the kauri-package-plugin for Maven. This will create a directory
structure containing a self-contained copy of your application,
include the necessary wrapper configuration and launch scripts.

See the Kauri documentation for more information on the kauri-package-plugin.
