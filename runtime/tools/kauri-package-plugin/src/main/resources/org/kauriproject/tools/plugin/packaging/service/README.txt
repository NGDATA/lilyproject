Service wrapper
===============

This directory contains the configuration files and launch scripts for
the Tanuki Javav Service Wrapper, which is included within Kauri.

To use it, you need to edit the service-wrapper.conf file, and adjust
the values of the following two statements:

set.default.KAURI_HOME=
set.default.KAURI_APPLICATION_HOME=

Then simply execute 'kauri-service' to launch.

For more detailed information, see the Kauri documentation.
