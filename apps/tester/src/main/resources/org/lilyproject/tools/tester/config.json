    Field types:

      * Define the field types that can be used in the record types.

      * These field types are automatically created if necessary.

      * If the field type would already exist but not correspond to the
        description here, an error will be generated.

      * The format to describe the field types is the similar as for the lily-import
        tool or the REST interface, please refer to their documentation for more
        details.
        
      * In addition there can be a properties parameter per field type.
        The content of this parameter depends on the valueType of the fieldType.
        * STRING :
          enum : A comma separated list of words that can be used when generating values.
                 A random word will be picked from this list.
                 If no enum is given, a big Word list will be used instead.
          wordCount : The number of words to concatenate, separated with spaces.
                      If no wordCount is given, a random number of words will be used.
        * INTEGER, LONG :
          enum : A comma separated list of numbers that can be used when generating values.  
                 A random number will be picked from this list.
          min, max : The mininum and maximum numbers between which to pick a number.
                     If enum is given, min and max are ignored.
                     If no min and max are given, MIN_VALUE and MAX_VALUE are used.
        * LINK :
          recordType : The link will contain a recordId to a record (or records in case of multivalue)
                       of that record type.
                       If no record type is given a random recordId will be generated.
          recordSource : The space from which to select a random recordId. 
                         If no recordSource is given a new record will be created of the given record type.
        * BYTEARRAY :
          length : the length of the ByteArray to generate
                         
      * For BLOB field types, generating a random value results in a random blob with a maximum size of 200MB to be uploaded.

/* Scenario :
   
   * The scenario describes the actions to perform in one iteration of the test
   * name : The name of the action, which will be used in the metrics.
   * action : The action code which must correspond to a TestAction class.
   * for read actions: readBlobs indicates if the the actual blob content needs to be read from the blobstore
   * count : The number of times to perform the action before going to the next action.
   * time : The time during which to repeat the action. If a non-negative number is given it takes precedence over count.
            Note that the maximumRuntime of the whole test is only checked once per iteration.
            If is therefore possible that a test will run longer than the given maximumRuntime.
   * recordType : The record type the action of performed upon.
   * recordIdPrefixNbrOfChars: Not required if you want auto generated UUID record ids. If you want timestamp based
                               record ids, than this is the amount of characters in the user record id (a string) which
                               are reserved for a round robin number (useful for region splitting). The whole record id
                               is constructed with the pattern [prefix][timestamp-in-ms][mac-address].
   * source : The record space to use as source for the action.
   * destination : The record space to use as destination for the action.
   * pattern : (Only applicable for Update action)
               The kind of update operation to perform.
               Can be one off : 
                 "all" : update all fields of the record

                 "random" : pick random fields from the record
                 * patternDetail : extra information for the pattern
                   * in case of fields pattern : a comma separated list of the fields to update
