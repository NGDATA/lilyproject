This tool can run in two modes:
 * count mode, activated with -c
 * print mode, activated with -p

To print just a few records, use the --limit option.

The full scanner configuration can be supplied as JSON, in the same format
as in the REST interface, so see its documentation for the full description.

Here is an example json config to filter on field value:

{
  recordFilter: {
    "@class": "org.lilyproject.repository.api.filter.FieldValueFilter",
    field: "{org.lilyproject.bookssample}language",
    compareOp: "EQUAL",
    fieldValue: {
      valueType: "STRING",
      value: "English"
    }
  }
}
