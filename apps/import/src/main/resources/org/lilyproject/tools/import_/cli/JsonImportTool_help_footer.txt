List one or more JSON files to be imported, for example:

lily-import -z server1:2181,server2:2181 file1.json file2.json

The input JSON format is described in the Lily documentation:
http://docs.ngdata.com/lily-docs-current/435-lily.html

Valid arguments for --format are:

  * json: (default) the file as a whole is one json object and can contain
          schema and records.

  * json_lines: each input line contains a json object describing a record,
                this format does not support defining a schema.

About ignore-empty-fields:
  when this option is specified, if you have any fields that contain empty
  strings as values, they will be removed from the input, thus effectively
  being the same as if the fields were not present in the input. If you
  have an empty string in an array, like ["a", "", "b"], it will also
  remove it, thus changing the array to ["a", "b"]. If an array doesn't
  contain any entries (anymore), the field is removed. When using nested
  records, if the filtering would result in the record not having
  any fields any more, the field containing the nested record will be
  removed.
About ignore-and-delete-empty-fields:
  this does the same as ignore-empty-fields, but will also actively add empty
  fields to the list of fields-to-delete. This distinction is important when
  updating records that might have an existing value for such fields.

You can significantly speed up the import by using multiple threads:
lily-import -w 20 ...
