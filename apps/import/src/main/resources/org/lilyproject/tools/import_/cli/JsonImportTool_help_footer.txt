List one or more JSON files to be imported, for example:

lily-import -z server1:2181,server2:2181 file1.json file2.json

The input JSON format is described in the Lily documentation:
http://docs.ngdata.com/lily-docs-current/435-lily.html

Valid arguments for --format are:

  * json: (default) the file as a whole is one json object and can contain
          schema and records.

  * json_lines: each input line contains a json object describing a record,
                this format does not support defining a schema.

You can significantly speed up the import by using multiple threads:
lily-import -w 20 ...
