This tool generates split keys that can be listed in the <splitKeys> tag in the
conf/general/tables.xml file:

  <table name="record">
    <splits>
      <splitKeys>OUTPUT OF THIS TOOL COMES HERE</splitKeys>
      <splitKeyPrefix></splitKeyPrefix>
    </splits>
  </table>

It supports generating splits for UUID record id's, as well as for USER record id's,
for this last one it is assumed the USER record id's start with random data in
hexadecimal form. This is what you get when prefixing your keys with a (short) hash
of themselves.

Note that if you just need splits on UUID's, you can use the <regionCount> tag
in the tables.xml.

The HBase row keys for Lily record id's start with a byte indicating the type
of record id:
 - 0 for USER
 - 1 for UUID

Thus UUID's are always sorted after the USER record id's and are not intermingled
with them.

If your data contains both UUID and USER record id's, this tool can create splits
for a combination of the two.

Example usage:

For only USER record id's:

generate-split-keys --userid-splits 15 -userid-splits-length 2

For a combination:

generate-split-keys --userid-splits 15 -userid-splits-length 2 --uuid-splits 30 --uuid-splits-length 5

The length parameters give the number of characters or bytes that the split keys should
have as length, excluding the type-prefix byte.
