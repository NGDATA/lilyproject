Lily Sample Repository Decorator Generated By Archetype
=======================================================

Build using:

mvn assembly:assembly

This will create a tarball containing a lib/ directory and plugins/ directory.
Copy the contents of the lib directory to the lib/ directory of your Lily installation.

Then copy the contents of the tarball's plugins directory to the Lily plugins directory.
The location of the Lily plugins directory varies depending on the kind of setup, and can be found by tracking the system property
lily.plugin.dir:
 - in the normal binary distribution, it is in root of the installation
   package
 - in Lily Enterprise: (TODO)
 - in the source tree: cr/process/server/plugins

Modify the configuration file conf/repository/repository.xml and add
the name of the decorator (this is the name defined in
SampleRepositoryDecorator.NAME).
