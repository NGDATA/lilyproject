Lily Sample Repository Decorator Generated By Archetype
=======================================================

Build using:

mvn install


Then copy the resulting jar file to the plugins/load-before-repository
directory. The location of the plugins directory varies depending on
the kind of setup, and can be found by tracking the system property
lily.plugin.dir:
 - in the normal binary distribution, it is in root of the installation
   package
 - in Lily Enterprise: (TODO)
 - in the source tree: cr/process/server/plugins

Modify the configuration file conf/repository/repository.xml and add
the name of the decorator (this is the name defined in
SampleRepositoryDecorator.NAME).
