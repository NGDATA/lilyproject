This tool is intended for debugging and learning purposes.

It shows the data which is stored in the HBase row of a record. It is not
a generic HBase tool but displays the data in a way that make sense for Lily,
and shows the various cell values in a decoded way.

Nonetheless, the tool shows all versions for each column, even if we know
Lily only store one, to be able to detect unexpected situations or version
numbers. It also shows the names of unexpected columns and column families.

The output of this tool is an HTML page.

You can view it in two ways:

 1. by redirecting the output to a file and opening it in your browser

    lily-record-row-visualizer > out.html
    firefox out.html

 2. render it on the command line using w3m

    lily-record-row-visualizer | w3m -T text/html -dump -cols 120
