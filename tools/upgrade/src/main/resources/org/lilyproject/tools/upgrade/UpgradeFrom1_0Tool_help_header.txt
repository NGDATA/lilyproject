This tool upgrades the Lily Schema on HBase from the schema used in Lily 1.0 to the schema used in Lily 1.1

It performs two conversions:
1) A conversion from 'null' namespaces in the names of record types and field types. 
   By default 'null' is replaced by an empty string. 
   If another namespace is required, specify this with the namespacevalue (-nsv) argument.

2) An upgrade of the encoding of value types inside the field types, including a conversion of multivalue
   and hierarchical value types to LIST and PATH value types. 

By default this tool only performs a dry-run, reporting the changes that would be applied. 
To really apply the changes, use the -a argument.

By default all upgrades are perfomed. 
To only run one or more upgrades, specify arguments of the required upgrades (-ns and -vt respectively).
