This tool is for experts.
It prints the rows from the MQ or WAL global rowlog table in a readable form.
Also shows the corresponding state and payload from the row-local queue.
It is not a generic rowlog tool, it is hardcoded for the Lily's MQ & WAL.
This tool does not modify anything so should be safe to run.
