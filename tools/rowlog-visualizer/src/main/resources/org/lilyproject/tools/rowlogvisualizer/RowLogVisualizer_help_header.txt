This tool is for experts.
It prints the rows from the MQ global rowlog table in a readable form.
Also shows the corresponding state and payload from the row-local queue.
It is not a generic rowlog tool, it is hardcoded for the Lily's MQ.
This tool does not modify anything so should be safe to run.
For indexes, the subscription name is of the form "IndexUpdater_{indexname}"
