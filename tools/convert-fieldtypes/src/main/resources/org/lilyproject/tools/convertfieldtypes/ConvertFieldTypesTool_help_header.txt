This tool converts the FieldType schema on HBase from the encoding used in Lily 1.0 to the encoding used in Lily 1.1
It is to be used when upgrading Lily from 1.0 to 1.1

The encoded value type is converted to the new encoding.
Multivalue types are converted to LIST types.
Hierarchy types are converted to PATH types.  

By default the changes are not applied, but only reported.
