About the lib directory
-----------------------

This directory contains a temporary solution for getting HBase and Zookeeper
installed in your local Maven repository. It is expected that these will
be soon available in public repositories, therefore we did not go through
the hassle of setting up our own repository yet. The pom's in this directory
are custom written.
