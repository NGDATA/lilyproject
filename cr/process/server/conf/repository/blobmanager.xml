  <!--  BlobIncubatorMonitor : Monitors the BlobIncubatorTable and cleans up any unused (stale) blobs. These are
                               blobs which were uploaded, but not actually used in records.

        minimalAge : The minimal age (in seconds) an unused blob needs to have before it gets deleted

        monitorDelay : The time (in milliseconds) to pause between individual blob checks.
                       This is used to control the load the BlobIncubatorMonitor generates on the system.
                       This should be a small value, e.g. if you take 20ms this means at most 50 expired
                       blobs can be handled per second (assuming a block check takes 0ms).

        runDelay : The minimal time (in seconds) between two runs of the monitor.
