/*
  This test creates records having a RECORD-type field which in turn contains
  100 fields.
  Because the fields are in an embedded record, this has the effect of
  storing them all in a single HBase column.
  Depending on access scenario's, this can be more efficient
  (especially if you always access all fields and don't need versioning).
